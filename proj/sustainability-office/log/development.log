Food moves to money and away from poverty, so I soon discovered the question I was really asking was: How do we tackle poverty without wrecking the planet? The answers still have a lot to do with agriculture, because 70 percent of the 700 million people living in extreme poverty across the globe are farmers, and no country has reduced poverty on a large scale without a corresponding investment in agriculture.\n\nThere’s a fundamental tension between these two goals because growth, the escalator out of poverty runs on fossil fuels and forests.\n\nThere are no perfect solutions. There’s always some tradeoff between alleviating poverty and protecting the environment. But there are good solutions: If we are smart, we can set our priorities to trade a little carbon for a lot of prosperity. My reporting on this issue has led me to the hypothesis that people who care about the environment and social justice should embrace change, growth, and innovation. We simply don’t have the technology, infrastructure, and basic housing to meet the needs of the global population. Traditionally the environmental movement has focused on stopping things — conservation and preservation aim to prevent change. But poor people need change. In this talk I’ll outline the historical evidence that suggests that growth — spurred by investments in small farms — can lead to mass reduction in poverty and environmental improvements."], ["created_at", "2018-04-01 14:08:25.330357"], ["updated_at", "2018-04-01 14:08:25.330357"], ["image_file_name", "poverty_first.png"], ["image_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["image_file_size", 15999], ["image_updated_at", "2018-04-01 14:08:23.081903"]]
