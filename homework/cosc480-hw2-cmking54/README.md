See homework instructions posted on Moodle.

## Homework feedback

 * How long did you spend on this homework?
    ** about 1-3 hours; sorry for the weird range but it went too quickly so I was slow myself down on purpose **

 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?
    ** As said above, I felt that this assignment was on the easier side, and I would advocate heavily for a more modular assignment for those who want exposure **
